abstract = {Battery evaluation and early prediction software package (BEEP) provides an open-source Python-based framework for the management and processing of high-throughput battery cycling data-streams. BEEPs features include file-system based organization of raw cycling data and metadata received from cell testing equipment, validation protocols that ensure the integrity of such data, parsing and structuring of data into Python-objects ready for analytics, featurization of structured cycling data to serve as input for machine-learning, and end-to-end examples that use processed data for anomaly detection and featurized data to train early-prediction models for cycle life. BEEP is developed in response to the software and expertise gap between cell-level battery testing and data-driven battery development.}

abstract = {This work presents a comprehensive degradation study of two types of large lithium-ion pouch cells; 26 NMC532/Graphite (64 Ah) and 9 NMC433/Graphite (31 Ah) pouch cells. The cells were degraded under different cycling conditions and periodically characterized at room temperature. Specifically, the effect of different ambient temperatures and constraining the cells by clamping was studied. Incremental capacity analysis is an in situ, non-invasive characterization technique that allows the identification of battery degradation modes, and is a technique that does not require additional and advanced equipment. Therefore, in this study we also look into applying the analysis technique on an existing data set. This is done by combining incremental capacity analysis on a qualitative level with the tracking of features of interest in the incremental capacity curve as a function of State of Health and utilizing the simulation of different degradation modes for a more in-depth analysis. We combine simulation and experimental incremental capacity analysis with conclusions from capacity loss and resistance changes with a focus on understanding the benefit and limitations of the incremental capacity analysis for large cells. This is important, as incremental capacity analysis is a relatively fast analysis to qualify large commercial batteries for 2nd life applications. Specifically in this study, we found that degradation and capacity loss do not always correlate. For the 64 Ah Cells cycled at 15 °C and 25 °C, the rate of capacity loss appeared to be similar, although the degradation modes and mechanisms are found to be very different. The clamping was the most important factor for impeding degradation. The 31 Ah Cell cycled at low temperatures showed a very poor cycling performance, where the incremental capacity analysis revealed that Loss of Lithium Inventory from fast and irreversible plating was responsible.}

ABSTRACT = {The galvanostatic charge&ndash;discharge (GCD) behaviour of silicon (Si) is known to depend strongly on morphology, cycling conditions and electrochemical environment. One common method for analysing GCD curves is through differential capacity, but the data processing required necessarily degrades the results. Here we present a method of extracting empirical information from the delithiation step in GCD data for Si at C-rates above equilibrium conditions. We find that the function is able to quickly and accurately determine the best fit to historical half-cell data on amorphous Si nanowires and thin films, and analysis of the results reveals that the function is capable of distinguishing the capacity contributions from the Li3.5Si and Li2Si phases to the total capacity. The method can also pick up small differences in the phase behaviour of the different samples, making it a powerful technique for further analysis of Si data from the literature. The method was also used for predicting the size of the reservoir effect (the apparent amount of Li remaining in the electrode), making it a useful technique for quickly determining voltage slippage and related phenomena. This work is presented as a starting point for more in-depth empirical analysis of Si GCD data.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of silicon (Si) in the form of nanoparticles is one of the most promising routes for boosting the capacity of modern Li-ion batteries. Many parameters influence the performance of Si making the comparison of materials complicated. The present work demonstrates a direct comparison of Si nanoparticles with amorphous and crystalline structures prepared through the same chemistry with the same particle size and morphology. The amorphous Si nanoparticles with an average diameter of 100 nm were synthesized through silane pyrolysis, and their crystalline analogues were obtained through subsequent annealing not altering size or morphology of the nanoparticles. Such direct comparison allows evaluation of the specific impact of crystallinity on the material's performance. From electrochemical analysis of these materials, the electrodes prepared from amorphous nanoparticles were found to exhibit improved cycle life compared to electrodes prepared from crystalline nanoparticles when the delithiation capacity of the anode was limited to 1000 mAh/gSi.},
